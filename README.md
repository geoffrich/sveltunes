# SvelteKit music app demo

This is a demo app showing off multiple features of SvelteKit. You can search for albums and artists, view information about each, and mark your favorite albums.

You will need a Discogs account and a Discogs API key to run this demo. You can get a key by [creating a new application.](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers)

This is meant to be a local demo and is **not suitable for deployment**, since "auth" is a setting a hard-coded session cookie and "the database" is an in-memory object.
