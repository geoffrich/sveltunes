# SvelteKit music app demo

You will need a Discogs account and a Discogs API key to run this demo. You can get a key by [creating a new application.](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers)

## TODO

- scroll not resetting properly when navigating (skeleton issue?)
- page titles using PageData
- not sure if I want to use app shell or not (see scroll issue)
- handle artist ID 194 - "various" (placeholder)
- improve pagination to only load additional data - +server.js endpoint
- actual "login" route that sets a cookie
- replace state after favoriting album to avoid cluttering history
- share more code between album and favorite page?
